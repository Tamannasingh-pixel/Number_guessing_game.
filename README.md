# Number_guessing_game.

This repository contains a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## Description

This game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The player receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

The game is implemented using Python's `random` module for number generation and utilizes if statements, functions, and loops to manage game flow and logic.

## Features

* Simple, text-based interface.
* Random number generation.
* Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
* Diffrent difficulty levels (Easy/Hard).
* Limited number of attempts.
* Clear and concise code structure.
